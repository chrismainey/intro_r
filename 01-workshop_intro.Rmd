# Course philosophy

Relaxed and informal  

Slides and code are available on [`r icons::fontawesome("github")`   GitHub](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r)    

The truth; but it can’t be the whole truth…  
too much to cover in a day

# Let's begin

class: center, middle

## R vs. RStudio
R is a programming language  

RStudio is a software application with tools to  

improve your programming experience

---

<img class="center" src="img/session01/roberto-nickson-unsplash.PNG"/>

# RStudio  

Many excellent features to help you with your analyses.  

Never again have to think about R and RStudio as separate:

Opening R Studio opens an R session.  

Analogy from the book Modern Dive:
[www.moderndive.com](www.moderndive.com)

# Open RStudio  

R Studio opens an R session

The Console is your window to R.  

You can code directly in the console…  

pi*2 <kbd> Enter </kbd>  
37/12 <kbd> Enter <kbd>  
… but there is a better way…

#### The Editor  

If you don’t see the Editor pane, click top right button  

And choose "R Script" from the drop down.  

Or, shortcut:  
<kbd> Ctrl + Shift + N </kbd>  

.blue[The cloud shortcut is <kbd> Ctrl + Shift + Alt + N </kbd>]

.left-column[
The Editor is just like any other text  
editor: you can copy, paste, and save text.  

<kbd> Ctrl + Z </kbd> undoes *but*  
<kbd> Ctrl + Shift + Z </kbd> to redo   
(.blue[not <kbd> Ctrl + y</kbd>])  

Different text is coloured  
(the console is uniform)  

Autocomplete  

<kbd>Ctrl + Enter </kbd>  
(sends line of  
code to Console)

# Packages  

### R packages are like apps for your phone:


--

Extend the capabilities of the basic or "base R"  
with extra functions, datasets, documentation.

---

<img class="center" src="img/session01/app_analogy.PNG"/>

---

# Packages

Quotations in R can be either "" or '' but cannot be mixed:

```{r echo=TRUE}

# either
install.packages("tidyverse")

# or
install.packages('tidyverse')
```


will download a package to your personal library. Then:  

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse) 
```

This tells R to load the package from your personal library and is .blue[needed for every new session/script]

## CRAN repository

[Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/)  

18,903 packages (April 2022). Free. Peer reviewed.  


(Manifold possibilities) eg. interactive graphics and  

dashboards, machine learning, mine twitter data,  

create PowerPoint docs, maps…  


## GitHub

Many useful packages in development or subject to a lot of change are not on CRAN and are available through GitHub including [{NHSRtheme}](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRtheme). These won't be peer reviewed.

## ROpenSci

ROpenSci offer a peer reviewed ecosystem of R packages through GitHub including UKHSA's [{fingertipsR}](https://github.com/ropensci/fingertipsR)

## What is the tidyverse?  

The [tidyverse package](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collects (some of) the most popular  
R packages into one.  

All have the same underlying principles:

Provide simple tools (with consistent structure) which may  
be used together to help solve complex problems.

---

class: center, middle

## What is the tidyverse?

During the workshop we will use the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/),  
and [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) packages. These are bundled up in the  
tidyverse package. Load it by running:  


```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

---
