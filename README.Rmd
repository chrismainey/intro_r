## Attending the course?

If you are attending the course all the course materials and preparation instructions are [here](https://philosopher-analyst.netlify.app/collection/nhsr-intro/prework/).

## Are you wanting to update or use the slide code?

This repository is split into 3 areas:

* [RMarkdown files and dependency files](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r/tree/main) - slides have been built in {xaringan} which requires the css, img and libs folder to render
* [html pages](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r/tree/gh-pages) - are automatically rendered using GitHub actions (no need to knit every file!) and are kept on a separate branch. The html files are published though GitHub [here](https://nhs-r-community.github.io/intro_r/) and being {xaringan} they are interactive and accessible
* [data files](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/intro_r_data/) are in a separate repository to help learners access the data files separate to the code for the slides

## Set-up

You will need to have R, R tools (on Windows), RStudio, and git installed in order to use this project locally.

[Clone the repository](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first.html#new-rstudio-project-via-git-clone), then run the following code chunk to initialise the project.

``` r
# the data directory is a git submodule, which needs to be downloaded
if (length(dir("data", ".csv")) == 0) {
  system("git submodule init")
  system("git submodule update")
}
# install all of the required packages
renv::restore()
# download fontawesome icons used in slides
icons::download_fontawesome()
```

Once you have run these steps, in RStudio you can open the individual Rmarkdown documents and render each file. Alternatively, you can render all of the slides at once using the "Build All" button on the "Build" tab in RStudio.
